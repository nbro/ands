# History

This project was created for _personal use_ mostly while studying for an _exam_ (starting in the month of June in 2015) of a previous course that I followed called _Algorithms and Data Structures_. 

I decided to make it publicly available to use and modify, so that people with difficulties in understanding and applying these topics can take benefit from it.

I discourage every beginner from copying **shamelessly** the source code, but  instead you should definitely give a chance to your brain and sense of challenge  first! At the end, you will definitely feel a better and more serious  programmer! If you really do not have any ideas on how to do something, try to  read the comments next to each function and/or class (or even the code itself) that you are interested in. They are there for a reason!
