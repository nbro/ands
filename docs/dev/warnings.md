# Warnings

- This is mostly a **personal project**, but I will accept PRs that fix bugs or introduce nice features
- This is a **work in progress**, so don't expect to find here all the algorithms and data structures you are searching. 
- **Mistakes in the implementations are possible**, even if I always try to test all the algorithms and data structures and I do some research before implementing them. You can find the unit tests under the folder [`tests`](../../tests). So, as the [license](../../LICENSE.md) says, this project is provided "as is".
- **No optimisation** has been done to any algorithm or data structure. The purpose of the implementations is just for **_exposition of the concepts_**. However, note that this does not mean that I don't strive to implement the most efficient known version of the algorithm.
- My intent is to continue to contribute to this repository in my free time, and **new data structures and algorithms** will therefore be added.
- The history of this repository was squashed into one commit the 27/12/2022 in order to remove all noisy commits. From now on, each commit should change one specific thing, which doesn't mean one specific file or function, as certain changes may need to be applied to different functions or files in order to make sense. The `main_27_12_2022` is a copy of the original branch that was squashed, which had already been rebased in order to clean up some commits.
