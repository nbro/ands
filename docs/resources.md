## Resources

For each module, I always try not to forget to specify the specific references that I used to implement the particular concept exposed in that module. 

Apart from those, the following are the references which I always keep an eye on:

- [_Introduction to Algorithms_ (3rd ed.)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms),  book by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein

- [Algorithms, 4th Edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), online book  by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

Additionally, there are many useful resources around the web to help you (and me) understand how certain algorithms or data structures work. Examples are

- [The Archive of Interesting Code](http://www.keithschwarz.com/interesting/) 
by Keith Schwarz

- [Notes on Data Structures and Programming Techniques](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/223/notes.html)

- [https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms](https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms)

- [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)
