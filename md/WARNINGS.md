# WARNINGS

- This is a **personal project**.
  - I will **not accept pull requests**.
  - However, if you find issues in the code, you can report them in the issue tracker.
- This is a **work in progress**, don't expect to find here all the algorithms and data structures you are searching. 
- Expect **breaking changes** across versions/commits, as this is an experimental project. 
  - Every once in a while, **I also rewrite the history of the commits** to make it more logical, so the time of the commits or pushes might not correspond to when I originally implemented and added the features.
  - Moreover, if you fork this repo, and if you try to fetch my updates or try to make a pull request (which I will not accept anyway), you could have conflicts after I have rewritten history.
- **Mistakes are possible**, even if I always try to test all the algorithms and data structures. You can find the unit tests under the folder [`tests`](../tests). So, as the [license](../LICENSE.md) says, this project is provided "as is".
- **No optimisation** has been done to any algorithm or data structure. The purpose of the implementations is just for **_exposition of the concepts_**. However, note that this does not mean that I don't strive to implement the most efficient known version of the algorithm.
- My intent is to continue to contribute to this repository in my free time, and **new data structures and algorithms** will therefore be added.
