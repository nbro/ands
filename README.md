## Introduction

This project was created for _personal use_ mostly while studying for an _exam_ 
(starting in the month of June in 2015) of a previous course that I followed called _Algorithms and Data Structures_ I decided to make it publicly available to use and modify, so that people with difficulties in understanding and applying these topics can take benefit from it. 

I discourage every beginner from copying **shamelessly** the source code, but 
instead you should definitely give a chance to your brain and sense of challenge 
first! At the end, you will definitely feel a better and more serious 
programmer! If you really do not have any ideas on how to do something, try to 
read the comments next to each function and/or class (or even the code itself) 
that you are interested in. They are there for a reason!

Any suggestions to improve the code, or the design of an algorithm or data 
structure, or corrections are of course welcome. Feel free to open an issue.

## Content

In this repository, you will find data structures, such as binary-search trees, 
and algorithms that often work on (those) data structures. You will also find 
some algorithms related to some particular design paradigm, for example 
algorithms related to the _greedy_ or _dynamic programming_ design paradigms.

## Notes, warnings and "philosophy"

- This is a **work in progress**, don't expect to find here all the data 
structures and algorithms you're searching. Consider to contribute to the 
quality and size of the project.

- Again, **mistakes are possible**, even if decent tests are starting to being 
done. You can find them under the folder [`tests`](tests). So, as the 
[license](LICENSE.md) says, this project is provided "as is", etc.

- **No optimisation** has been done to any algorithm or data structure. The 
purpose of the implementations is just for **_exposition of the concepts_**!

- My intent is to continue to contribute to this repository in my free time, and 
**new data structures and algorithms** will therefore be added.


## References

For each module I always try not to forget to specify the specific references 
that I used to implement the particular concept exposed in that module. 

Apart from those, the following are the references which I always keep an eye on:

- [_Introduction to Algorithms_ (3rd ed.)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms), book by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein

- Slides provided by the prof. [Antonio Carzaniga](http://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/)

- Slides provided by the prof. E. Papadopoulou.

- [Algorithms, 4th Edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), online book by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)


## Resources

There many useful resources around the web to help you (and me) understand how 
certain algorithms or data structures work.

One curated list that I found useful which points to a bunch of other resources 
is the following:
