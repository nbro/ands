# Description

Ternary-search tries (or trees) combine the time efficiency of other tries
with the space efficiency of binary-search trees.

An advantage compared to hash maps is that ternary search tries support sorting,
but the _keys_ of a ternary-search trie can only be _strings_,
whereas a hash map supports any kind of hashable keys.

## TSTs vs Hashing

### Hashing

- Need to examine entire key
- Search miss and hits cost about the same
- Performance relies on hash function
- Does NOT support ordered symbol table operations

### TSTs

- Works only for strings (or digital keys)
- Only examines just enough key characters
- Search miss may involve only a few characters
- Supports ordered symbol table operations:
    - keys-that-match
    - keys-with-prefix
    - longest-prefix-of

### Bottom line

TSTs are:

- faster than hashing (especially for search misses)
- more flexible than red-black trees

        The search in a TST works as follows.

        We start at the root and we compare its character with the first character of key.
            - If they are the same, we follow the middle link of the root node.
            - If the first character of key is smaller lexicographically
            than the key at the root, then we take the left link or pointer.
            We do this because we know that all strings that start with characters
            that are smaller lexicographically than key[0] are on its left subtree.
            - If the first character of key is greater lexicographically
            than the key at the root, we take similarly the right link or pointer.

        We keep applying this idea at every node.
        Moreover, WHEN THERE'S A MATCH, next time we compare the key
        of the next node with the next character of key.

        For example, if there's a match between the first node (the root) and key[0],
        we follow the middle link, and the next comparison is between
        the key of the specific next node and key[1], not key[0]!
