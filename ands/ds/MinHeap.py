# Description

A binary min-heap is a data structure similar to a binary tree,
where the parent nodes are smaller or equal to their children.

In addition to the previous constraint, a binary min-heap is a complete binary tree,
that is, all levels of the tree, except possibly the deepest one are fully filled,
and, if the last level of the tree is not complete,
the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.

A min-heap can be implemented with a classic array or list in Python.

If we have a node at index i, then

- its left child can be found at index i*2 + 1

- its right child is found at i*2 + 2,

- its parent can be found at index floor((i - 1) / 2),
where floor(x) truncates x to the smallest integer.

Note that these indexes are for 0-index based lists (or arrays).
