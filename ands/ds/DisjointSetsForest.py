# Description

A disjoint-set (forests) or union-find data structure is a data structure which keeps track of a set of elements
partitioned into disjoint (non-overlapping, i.e. their intersection is the empty set) sets.
The usual operations supported by this data structure are:

  1. make-set(x): creates a single-element set containing x, and x is the representative of that set.

  2. find(x): returns the "representative" of the set where the element x is.
    If the data structure is implemented a tree, the representative is the root of the tree.

  3. union(x, y): unions the sets where x and y are (if they do not belong already to the same set).

`DisjointSetsForest` uses two heuristics that improve the performance with respect to a naive implementation.

  1. Union by rank: attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree

  2. Path compression: is a way of flattening the structure of the tree whenever find is used on it.

These two techniques complement each other: applied together, the amortized time per operation is only O( &alpha; (n)).

## Public interface

- make_set(x): add x to the DisjointSetsForest
- find(x): returns the root or representative of x
- union(x, y): unites the sets where x and y reside
- print_set(x): prints the set where x resides to the standard output
- contains(x): check if x is in the DisjointSetsForest
- size: returns the number of elements add to the data structure (using make_set)
- sets: returns the number of disjoint sets currently in the data structure

All other methods or fields are considered private and were NOT intended to be used by clients!

# TODO

- Deletion operation (OPTIONAL, since it's usually not part of the interface of a disjoint-set data structure)
- Pretty-print(x), for some element x in the disjoint-set data structure.
- Implement the version explained [here](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/)
- Add complexity analysis for print_set

        It also uses a technique called "path compression",
        which is a way of flattening the structure of the tree.

        The idea is that each node visited on the way to a root node
        may as well be attached directly to the root node;
        they all share the same representative.

        To effect this, as `self.find` recursively traverses up the tree,
        it changes each node's parent reference
        to point to the root that it found.

        The resulting tree is much flatter,
        speeding up future operations not only on these elements
        but on those referencing them, directly or indirectly.

        This algorithm does not change any ranks of the `Set` objects.

        where &alpha; (n) is the inverse of the function n = f(x) = A(x, x),

        &alpha; (n) is less than 5 for all remotely practical values of n.
        Thus, the amortized running time per operation
        is effectively a small constant."""

        Returns the root object representing the representative of
        the set resulted from the union of the sets containing `x` and `y`.
        It returns None if `x` and `y` are already in the same set.

        "Union by rank" consists of attaching the smaller tree
        to the root of the larger tree.

        Since it is the depth of the tree that affects the running time,
        the tree with smaller depth gets added under the root of the deeper tree,
        which only increases the depth if the depths were equal.

        In the context of this algorithm, the term _rank_ is used instead of depth,
        since it stops being equal to the depth if path compression is also used.

        The rank is an upper bound on the height of the node.

        One-element trees are defined to have a rank of zero,
        and whenever two trees of the same rank `r` are united,
        the rank of the result is `r + 1`.
