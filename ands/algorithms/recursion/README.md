# [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))


Algorithms which are, in my opinion, good and simple examples to show how recursion works.

There are other recursive algorithms in this project that would also be good examples to show how recursion works (for example [`quick_sort`](../sorting/quick_sort.py)), but I thought they would be better examples of other concepts.
