# Description

## Parts of the quick-sort algorithm

1. **Partition**

    All elements smaller than a number  usually called "pivot" are put to the left of the pivot.

    In this partition algorithm, the pivot is chosen to be the last element of the range [`start`, `end`],
    but it could also have been chosen, e.g., to be the middle element.

    We keep searching for elements less than the pivot,
    from the left to the right of the range [`start`, `end`[,
    and we insert them at the position tracked by the variable `p`.

    So, `p` keeps track of the position (or index) in the range [`start`, `end`[,
    where all elements to the left of `p` are smaller than the pivot.
    Before returning this position (`p`), the pivot is inserted in that position.
    Note that doing this, the pivot will be already in its final sorted position.

2. **Recursive Calls**

    `quick_sort` is called recursively on the left of the pivot and on the right until `start >= end`.

# TODO

- Add ASCII animation of a sorting example using quick-sort!
- Improve efficiency of best case time complexity and space complexity.
