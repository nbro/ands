## Parts of the quicksort algorithm

1. **Partition**

    All elements smaller than a number  usually called "pivot"
    are put to the left of the pivot.

    In this quick sort algorithm, the pivot is chosen to be
    the last element of the range [`start`, `end`],
    but it could also have been choosen, e.g., to be the middle element.

    We keep searching for elements less than the pivot,
    from the left to the right of the range [`start`, `end`[,
    and we insert them at the position tracked by the variable `p_index`.

    So, `p_index` keeps track of the position (or index)
    in the range [`start`, `end`[, where all elements to the left of `p_index` are smaller than the pivot.
    Before returning this position (`p_index`), the pivot is inserted in that position.
    Note that doing this, the pivot will be already in its final sorted position.

2. **Recursive Calls**

    `quick_sort` is called recursively
    on the left of the pivot and on the right until `start >= end`.
