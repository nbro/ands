# Sorting Algorithms

Under this folder you can find some of the most famous sorting algorithms, such as 

- quick sort 
- merge sort
- insertion sort, etc.

All algorithms in this folder are in-place except from merge sort.

The time complexities of the algorithms can be found in the doc-strings of the function. Unless otherwise specified, time complexities are for the worst case.

Other descriptions might be provided, but this is not sure (for now).

In general, I try to specify the type of each argument,
but I might also have forgotten to do it in some places.
