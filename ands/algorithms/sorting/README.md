# [Sorting Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)

Under this folder you can find some of the most famous sorting algorithms, such as 

- quick sort 
- merge sort
- insertion sort, etc.

All algorithms in this folder are in-place except from merge sort.

The time complexities of the algorithms can be found in the doc-strings of the function. Unless otherwise specified, time complexities are for the worst case.
