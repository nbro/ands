# Description

It is a simple sorting algorithm which sorts a list by shifting elements one by
one. Following are some of the important characteristics of insertion-sort.

    1. It has one of the simplest implementations

    2. It is efficient for smaller lists, but inefficient for larger ones
    (compared to quick-sort, heap-sort or merge-sort).

    3. insertion-sort is adaptive, that means it reduces its total number of
    steps if given a partially sorted list, hence it increases its efficiency.

    4. It is stable, as it does not change the relative order of elements with
    equal keys.

    5. It's better than bubble-sort for almost-ordered lists, even though both
    have a best-case time complexity of O(n).

# TODO

- Add ASCII animation of a sorting example using insertion-sort!
