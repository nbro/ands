# Description

Selection sorting is conceptually probably the most simplest sorting algorithm.

This algorithm first finds the smallest element in the list and exchanges it with the element in the first position,
then find the second smallest element and exchange it with the element in the second position,
and continues in this way until the entire list is sorted.
