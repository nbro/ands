# Algorithms

Algorithms I am particularly interested in are:

- Bisection method
- Fixed-point iteration
- Secant method
- [All nearest smaller values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_nearest_smaller_values)
- Jacobi
- PageRank
- PowerMethod
- Kernighan–Lin algorithm (i.e. for partitioning a graph)
- Conjugate gradient (gradient descent and ascent)
- Cuthill–McKee algorithm
- Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm (i.e. for matrix multiplication)
- Strassen algorithm (i.e. for matrix multiplication), which is theoretically slower than the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm.
- Block matrix multiplication (to reduce theoretically, given a certain simplified memory hierarchy model, the memory accesses)
- Gauss-Newton algorithm
- Gauss–Seidel method
- Guassian elimination
- Guassian elimination with pivoting
- LU decomposition (or factorization)
- Cholesky decomposition (for symmetric positive definite matrices)
- A<sup>*</sup>
- MCTS
- Christofides algorithm
- Fisher–Yates shuffle
- Alpha-beta pruning
- Minmax
- Graham's scan
- Gift wrapping algorithm 
- RSA
- AKS primality test
- Miller–Rabin primality test
- Edmonds–Karp algorithm
- Floyd–Warshall algorithm
- Mersenne twister (pseudo-random generator)
- Euclidean algorithm (to compute the greatest common divisor)
- CYK algorithm
- Levenshtein edit distance
- Kosaraju's algorithm
