    It does not return which rod pieces

    The rod cutting problem is the following:
    given a rod of length n,
    and a table of prices p_i, for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,
    determine the maximum revenue r_n obtainable
    by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

    Note that if the price p_n
    for a rod of length n is large enough,
    an optimal solution may require no cutting at all.

    We can cut up a rod of length n in 2^{n - 1} different ways,
    since we have an independent option of cutting, or not cutting,
    at distance i inches from the left end,
    for i = 1, 2, ... , n - 1.
