# Description

The longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given
sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to
highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.

This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.

Longest increasing subsequences are studied in the context of various
disciplines related to mathematics, including algorithmics, random matrix
theory, representation theory, and physics.

# TODO

- Add complexity analysis.
- Improve documentation under functions.
- Add ASCII art to explain the problem
- Implement recursive longest common substring:
