# Description

Consider a set of requests for a room.
Only one person can reserve the room at a time, and you want to allow the maximum number of requests.

The requests for periods (si=start time for i, fi=finish time for i) are:

    (1, 4), (3, 5), (0, 6), (5, 7), (3, 8), (5, 9), (6, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (2, 13), (12, 14)

Where for example in (1, 4), s1 = 1 and f1 = 4. Which ones should we schedule?

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming, but it we can also solve it using a simple greedy algorithm.

The algorithm consists of basically choosing the next activity with the smallest finish time.
So, to do this, we need first to sort the activities by finish time.

This algorithm is a top-down algorithm, in the sense that we can start by choosing an activity,
the one with the earliest finish time, and then we can do the same for the remaining sub-problems.

# TODO

- Create tests for these functions
- Add complexity analysis
- Organize better the code and check for bugs
