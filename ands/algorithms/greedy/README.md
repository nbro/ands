# [Greedy Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)


## TODO

- [Reverse-delete algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-delete_algorithm) to find a minimum spanning tree.


- Greedy graph coloring (does not produce an optimal solution!)

- Change making, which does not produce always an optimal solution. I have already implemented a change making algorithm, which produces an optimal solution, using dynamic programming.
