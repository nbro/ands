# Primes

Primes are interesting numbers. A prime is a number that is greater than 1 and 
is divisible only by itself and 1. The only even number that is prime is 2. 
Therefore, all primes different from 2 are odd. 1 could be considered a prime, 
since it is divible only by itself and 1 (itself), but it isn't because it is 
"convenient" to considered it a non-prime number for a few reasons. One of them 
is that the [_fundamental theorem of arithmetic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic) 
would break if 1 was prime.

## [Prime Number Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem)

> In number theory, the prime number theorem (PNT) describes the asymptotic 
distribution of the prime numbers among the positive integers. It formalizes 
the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by 
precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs.
